# DES
Dynamic Exponential Smoothing

This repository contains a paper describing DES including high level theory and examples. The code for the model is implemented in model.py file and the model selection algorithm in model_search.py file.

Moreover, we provide Jupyter Notebooks that have implemented the method of DES and model search to demonstrate it's usage.

The requirements for execution can be found in the des.yml file. To install the requirements through conda use "conda env create -f des.yml"
